### Summary

This repository contains solutions to homework problems assigned in Math 5080/5090 from the text, Bain and Engelhardt's Introduction to Probability and Mathematical Statistics.

To view solutions, open the PDF files.

To make contributions, you will need to add or modify LaTeX (*.tex) files. There is a master LaTeX file called Solutions.tex.
There is also a separate file for each homework problem. Solutions.tex calls each of the separate homework problem files to compile a single document will all the solutions. Thus if you want to fix or improve the solution to problem 5 from chapter 8, you will edit 05.08.tex and then compile Solutions.tex.

LaTeX files and Solutions.pdf will be tracked with git.  Please do not commit other stuff, e.g. *.log files.

#### Missing solutions

Missing solutions (as of 12-7):
* Chapter 6: 17, 31

### Adding and modifying files

A Git client and a GitHub account are both required to contribute homework solutions. See [this video](http://youtu.be/ezxRcdJ8glM) for a step-by-step guide to setting up a GitHub account.

Git can be used from the command line and from GUI-based applications.

For the uninitiated, GitHub has easy to use GUI clients for [Windows](https://windows.github.com) and [Mac OS X](https://mac.github.com) that will make interacting with GitHub repositories much easier.

A [fork and pull collaboration model](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) will be used to add or modify the LaTeX files. 

#### Fork

To contribute your homework solution, start by creating your own copy of this repository. This process is called [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo). Add new LaTeX files for missing solutions or modify an existing file to fix or improve a previously contributed solution as described above.
